# Get also power and energy for methods starting with this package.class.method name
# Example: filter-method-names=Package to filter energy for all methods whose full name start with Package
# Note that JoularJX will always generate energy for all non-filtered method in a separate file
# So you can safely keep this empty if you don't want to filter methods
# You can add multiple identifiers names separated by a comma, ordered by priority
# JoularJX will monitor and filter methods for all these packages
# Example: filter-method-names=Package,Package2,Package3
filter-method-names=no.kantega

# Set to OFF to disable it
# Allowed values: OFF, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE

# Setting this option to true will generate one CSV file per monitored method
# Each CSV file will contain the power consumption on every monitored timestamp

# Overwrite runtime call trees power data file. If set to true, only one runtime file will be generated, and it will be overwritten for each monitoring cycle.

# If running the application on top of an application server or framework (spring, tomcat, etc.)

# Path for power consumption of the virtual machine
# Inside a virtual machine, indicate the file containing power consumption of the VM
# File usually shared with host to propagate the power of the VM from the host
# And use this value as the emulated CPU power inside the VM

# Power format of the shared VM power file
# We currently support two formats:
# powerjoular: a csv file generated by PowerJoular in the host, containing
#              3 columns: timestamp, CPU utilization of the VM and CPU power of the VM
# watts: a file containing one float value which is the power consumption of the VM
# Values: powerjoular, watts
